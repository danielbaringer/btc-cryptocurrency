About Json Files
I found some issues on the json file:
1- There was an syntax error  on the structure data file, but it was fixed
2-Json elements with room between words. On my opinion it should be set with no room.
 
3- On my opinion, I found some weird data structure regarding Illustrator and Genres specification: 
Some books contain basic string strucuture,  however, others contain an string array structure. It was handled by an unusual object variable on the C# back-end code.

Ilustrator and Genred should have the same structure for the whole json file, that is, it should be everything as string or everything as array
